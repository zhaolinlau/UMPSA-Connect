[UMPSA Connect](https://umpsa-connect.vercel.app/) is my final year project at [University of Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah](https://www.umpsa.edu.my/en). It serves as a comprehensive solution to enhance communication, streamline information dissemination, foster engagement, and improve data security across the entire UMPSA community. By providing users with easy access to relevant information and facilitating seamless communication, the platform aims to create a more connected and informed campus environment.
